I am a PhD student in **Computational Biology** in the **School of Computer Science** at [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/), advised by [Leila Wehbe](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lwehbe/index.html). My PhD research focuses on developing machine learning methods to better understand (1) how our brains process the world around us, and (2) individual differences between our brains in the presence and absence of disease. I am passionate about developing machine learning methods for healthcare, as well as methods focused on graph-based problems and causality.

Before I joined CMU, I recieved a MSc in [Integrated Systems Biology](https://wwwde.uni.lu/studiengaenge/fstm/master_in_integrated_systems_biology) from the University of Luxembourg and a MS in [Interdisciplinary Natural Sciences](https://www.roswellpark.org/education/masters-phd-programs/masters-program) (now known as Cancer Sciences) from the University at Buffalo, Roswell Park Cancer Institute. In my Master's thesis I computationally and experimentally interrogated the role of Vitamin D in Prostate Cancer, advised by [Barbara Foster](https://www.roswellpark.org/barbara-foster).
