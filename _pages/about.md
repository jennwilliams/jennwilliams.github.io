I'm a Senior Research Engineer at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/), where I focus on Generative AI, including inference optimization.

Before joining NVIDIA, I was a Machine Learning Scientist at [CVS Health](https://www.cvshealth.com/), where I led the development and deployment 
of machine learning solutions, including Generative AI solutions, that improved customer satisfaction and boosted employee productivity. 

I obtained my PhD from the **School of Computer Science** at [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/), advised by [Leila 
Wehbe](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lwehbe/index.html). My research focused on the intersection of machine learning, natural language processing (NLP) and healthcare. 
In particular, I developed machine learning methods to better understand how our brains process real-world language, images, and environments in both 
health and disease states. I also worked on graph-based problems and causal inference methods. 

Before CMU, I completed master's degrees in [Integrated Systems Biology](https://wwwde.uni.lu/studiengaenge/fstm/master_in_integrated_systems_biology) at the 
University of Luxembourg and in [Interdisciplinary Natural Sciences](https://www.roswellpark.org/education/masters-phd-programs/masters-program) (now know as Cancer Sciences) 
from the University at Buffalo, Roswell Park Cancer Institute. My Master's thesis delved into pharmacogenomics, investigating the impact of Vitamin D on Prostate Cancer, 
advised by [Barbara Foster](https://www.roswellpark.org/barbara-foster).  
 
With a foundation in AI and interdisciplinary research, I'm passionate about transforming research into innovations that drive real-world impact.
