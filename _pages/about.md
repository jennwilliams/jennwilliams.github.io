As a Senior Machine Learning Scientist at [CVS Health](https://www.cvshealth.com/), I lead the development and deployment of machine learning solutions, including Generative AI, that drive customer satisfaction and improve healthcare outcomes. 

I obtained my PhD from the **School of Computer Science** at [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/), advised by [Leila 
Wehbe](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lwehbe/index.html). My research focused on the intersection of machine learning, natural language processing (NLP) and healthcare. In particular, I developed machine learning methods to increase our understanding of how our brains process real-world language, images, and environments in both health and disease states. Additionally, my expertise extends to developing machine learning methods for graph-based problems and causality. 

Before joining CMU, I earned a MSc in [Integrated Systems Biology](https://wwwde.uni.lu/studiengaenge/fstm/master_in_integrated_systems_biology) from the University of Luxembourg and a MS in [Interdisciplinary Natural Sciences](https://www.roswellpark.org/education/masters-phd-programs/masters-program) (now known as Cancer Sciences) from the University at Buffalo, Roswell Park Cancer Institute. My Master's thesis delved into pharmacogenomics, investigating the impact of Vitamin D on Prostate Cancer, advised by [Barbara Foster](https://www.roswellpark.org/barbara-foster).  
 
With a Ph.D. with a focus on natural language processing and a diverse background in interdisciplinary research, my passion lies in propelling innovation in industry.
